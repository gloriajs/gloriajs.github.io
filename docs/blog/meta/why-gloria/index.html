            <h1>Why Gloria</h1>

            <p>I got super frustrated because Jekyll stopped working on my computer, so I figured it 
would be faster to create a new system from scratch than debug ruby gems. 
I was wrong, but it was a lot of fun and learning.</p>
<p>The system is not ready to release yet, the sites you build might need some tweaking and have some
limitations, but it works very well and if you&#39;re willing to tinker with it, you can have
production ready websites pretty quickly.</p>
<p>I will be adding instructions soon about deploying to github and firebase.</p>
<p>It&#39;s also a very young project, so feel free to poke around and contribute! and ask me anything :D</p>
<h2 id="easy-access">Easy access</h2>
<p>Another reason for Gloria is creating an open source project that is super friendly for
beginers. I mentor different students from some bootcamps and other groups, and sometimes
they struggle getting started in open source projects. I know I did the first time I gave it a try.</p>
<p>Gloria aims to be a very friendly community, with code being easy to read and understand, and with
its members willing to collaborate and pair with new contributors to get them onboard.</p>
<p>There are many projects like this, but this is ours. Enjoy!</p>
