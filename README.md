# Gloria - static site generator

*gloria is spanish for glory*

This project aims to be a substitute for jekyll, to create simple static websites with markdown and using the file system as storage.

Moving from abandonware to v2. Future versions should be backwards compatible with sites created using this version.

## Install

`yarn add gloriajs`

## Local Usage

Clone a template repo or start a new project and add gloria to it, copy the basic configuration from this repo and follow the correct folder structure.

To test your local changes, the default build location is `build`. You can use a generic http web server to preview the contents locallY.

```
npx -y http-server build
```

Rebuilding the project with `yarn build` should recreate the resulting files in that folder.

To enable a local serve command that watches files and refreshes the page checkout this [github issue](https://github.com/gloriajs/gloria/issues/134).

## Contributing & Development

Fork and clone the repo and follow the instructions.

Some files maybe are generated by the `@gloriajs/gloria` repo.

### Local development

Use your local version of `@gloriajs/gloria` by having a sibling folder with the pacakge contents, then run commands with `npm run gloria-local -- `.
This will help you test out gloria features during development with a live repo before publishing.

Send a pull request with your changes to the tool repo, or the docs repo when appropiate, and await any further comments.
