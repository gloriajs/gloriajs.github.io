# Gloria - static site generator

*gloria is spanish for glory*

This project aims to be a substitute for [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), to create simple static websites with markdown and using the file system as storage.

For the documentation, visit our website [gloriajs.github.io](https://gloriajs.github.io), to
contribute visit our [github repo](https://github.com/dvidsilva/gloria). Discord or other comms channels coming soon.

Moving from abandonware to v2.
