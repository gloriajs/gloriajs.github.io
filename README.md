# Gloria - static site generator

*gloria is spanish for glory*

This project aims to be a substitute for [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), to create simple static websites with markdown and using the file system as storage.

contribute visit our [github repo](https://github.com/dvidsilva/gloria). [Github Community forums](https://github.com/gloriajs/gloriajs.github.io/discussions).

Moving from abandonware to v2.

## Contributing & Development

Fork and clone the repo and follow the instructions.

Some files maybe are generated by the `@gloriajs/gloria` repo.

### Local development
