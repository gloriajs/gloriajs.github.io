# Code Of Conduct

Our open source community is a group of people committed to developing awesome software that Works. 

Every other concern is subordinate to this goal. 

We recognize that there are certain kinds of childish behavior that are unwelcome in our community. 

We respond to such behavior by generally ignoring and/or—in extreme cases—making sport of, individuals who engage in such behavior. 

We accept everyone's contributions, we don't care if you're liberal or conservative, black or white, straight or gay, or anything in between! In fact, we won't bring it up, or ask. 

Those conversations have no place in the repo, issues or slack. 

Repeat offenders will probably get banned. 

If you need to complain about someone's behavior or report something never do it in public, message the maintainers on slack.
