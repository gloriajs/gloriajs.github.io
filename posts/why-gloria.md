I got super frustrated because Jekyll stopped working on my computer, so I figured it 
would be faster to create a new system from scratch than debug ruby gems. 
I was wrong, but it was a lot of fun and learning.

The system is not ready to release yet, the sites you build might need some tweaking and have some
limitations, but it works very well and if you're willing to tinker with it, you can have
production ready websites pretty quickly.

I will be adding instructions soon about deploying to github and firebase.

It's also a very young project, so feel free to poke around and contribute! and ask me anything :D

## Easy access

Another reason for Gloria is creating an open source project that is super friendly for
beginers. I mentor different students from some bootcamps and other groups, and sometimes
they struggle getting started in open source projects. I know I did the first time I gave it a try.

Gloria aims to be a very friendly community, with code being easy to read and understand, and with
its members willing to collaborate and pair with new contributors to get them onboard.

There are many projects like this, but this is ours. Enjoy!
